The goal of this page is to enumerate **platforms that allow to search for code** (literal or regex) in across thousands/millions of repos in one or more platforms.

This helps in several occasions to **search for leaked information** or for **vulnerabilities** patterns.

* [**SourceGraph**](https://sourcegraph.com/search): Search in millions of repos. There is a free version and an enterprise version (with 15 days free). It supports regexes.
* [**Github Search**](https://github.com/search): Search across Github. It supports regexes.
  * Maybe it's also useful to check also [**Github Code Search**](https://cs.github.com/).
* [**Gitlab Advanced Search**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/search/advanced\_search.html): Search across Gitlab projects. Support regexes.
* [**SearchCode**](https://searchcode.com/): Search code in millions of projects.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When you look for leaks in a repo and run something like `git log -p` don't forget there might be **other branches with other commits** containing secrets!
